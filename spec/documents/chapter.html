<h1>Basic Content Elements</h1>

<p>HTML only represents a fraction of the effort that goes into building
  an effective web site, because the HTML vocabulary that you usually <em>need</em> is
  small. Altogether that vocabulary amounts to <strong>24 elements</strong> &mdash;
  all of which are easy to remember and use, and nearly half of which are
  nearly identical in behavior to other elements on the list.</p>
<p>Many of these basic elements define structures that are familiar to users
  of word processing software; in addition to headings they include lists,
  paragraphs, and in bold/italic formatting.</p>
<p>There are also two <strong>container</strong> elements that HTML4.01 makes
  essential to effective stylesheets. In HTML5 those are supplanted by <strong>sectioning</strong> elements,
  which are introduced here and explained in the Advanced Topics.</p>

<h2>Review and Related Concepts</h2>

<ul class="punchlist">
  <li>The HTML Vocabulary is large, but the fraction of it that you need to
    know contains hardly more than a dozen unique elements.</li>
  <li>The number of non-global attributes that you need to know to use that
    basic HTML vocabulary can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</li>
  <li>HTML elements take default style values, which can be overridden with
    custom CSS.</li>
  <li>When you use <strong>container elements</strong> well, stylesheets are easier
    to write.</li>
  <li>A number of HTML5 elements cover the needs not only of <em>containing</em> content,
    but also dviding it into <strong>sections</strong> of varying purpose and
    importance.</li>
  <li>Headings are used to introduce content at descending levels of scope;
    the lower the heading level, the narrower the scope of the content it introduces.</li>
  <li>Inline frames often provide an environment for third-party content like
    video, social media buttons, and advertising.</li>
  <li>Web browsers typically support four image formats, each suited to certain
    uses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hypertext Links: the <code>a</code> Element</h2>

    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>It could be said that <code>a</code> is the grandaddy of all HTML elements,
  because &mdash; unlike the others &mdash; it does the work the web was
  meant for: describing human-readable links to other pages.</p>
<p>The contents of a link can amount to almost anything, especially in HTML5.</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>

<ul class="pairings">
  <li><strong>href</strong><span>Contains a valid URL that defines the destination of the link.</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>rel</strong><span>Takes values that define the relationship of the link to other resources.</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>target</strong><span>Set when the destination of the link should open in an inline frame.  The <code>onclick</code> event handler should be used if the link is to open in a new tab or window.</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>hreflang</strong><span>Declares the language at the destination of the link; best used when the language in question is different than the language of the current page.</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong class="html5">type</strong><span>Like the <code>hreflang</code> attribute, <em>advises</em> about the characteristics of the link&rsquo;s destination &mdash; in this case, with respect to MIME type.</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong class="html5">media</strong><span>Where <code>type</code> advises about the destination&rsquo;s MIME type, this attribute advises about its intended medium, for example <code>print</code> or <code>screen</code>.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Publishing Effective Links</h3>

<p>You should remember two rules when publishing a link: to be effective,
  it must be <strong>recognizable</strong> and <strong>lead to a meaningful destination</strong>.</p>
<p>A properly signaled link usually relies on two visual cues: color and
  underlining, these days controlled with the CSS <code>color</code> and <code>text-decoration</code> properties.
  Other links are instead designed to look like buttons, though they don&rsquo;t
  often jitter like buttons when followed.</p>
<p>There is also the navigation area common to most sites, which usually
  appears in an upper corner of the page, or as a row of links underneath
  the title of the site.</p>

<h3>Homepage Links and Self-Links</h3>

<p>The title of a site often takes the form of a link back to its homepage.
  A quick survey of the Google News, NBC News, CNN, Fox News, BBC, and Australian
  Broadcasting Corporation News sites all demonstrate this behavior, as do
  popular non-news destinations like Amazon, Wikipedia, and Flickr.</p>
<p>Older pages also contain links to the pages on which they&rsquo;re published.
  From time to time you might look at the status bar of your browser and
  see &ldquo;go to # on this page&rdquo; or something similar, especially
  on sites meant to function well in older browsers, which provide better
  scripting interfaces for links than for other elements.</p>

<h2><code>div</code></h2>

<table>
  <col id="engName" />
  <col id="endTag" />

    <td>None, but <code>id</code> or <code>class</code> should usually be present</td>
    <td>Flow/block</td>
    <td>None</td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>div</code> element is generic by design, and does a lot of HTML&rsquo;s
  heavy lifting. Unlike paragraphs, <code>div</code>s don&rsquo;t carry any
  inherent meaning or default styles, instead relying on their <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> values
  to offer some kind of clue as to their purpose and appearance.</p>
<p>When browsers render a <code>div</code> off the bat, the result has no margins
  and stretches horizontally across the entire canvas.</p>### <code>div</code> and
the Style Cascade
<p>In HTML4.01 especially, the purpose of <code>div</code> elements is to serve
  as <strong>containers</strong> that can be referenced in stylesheet selectors <small>xref</small>.
  If you create:</p>
<pre class="code-cutout">&lt;div id=&quot;sidebar&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bowl was full of &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.com/&quot;&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a 
  href=&quot;http://www.orange.com/&quot;&gt;oranges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>&hellip;You can then create a style rule for all of the hyperlinks that
  might lie inside <code>#sidebar</code>, like the following:</p>
<pre class="code-cutout">#sidebar a { color: #633; }</pre>

<p>&hellip;As an alternative to creating a <code>class</code> for all of the
  links inside of <code>#sidebar</code>.</p>

<h3>Sectioning Elements: <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>section</code>, and <code>aside</code></h3>

<p>[class=&quot;html5&quot;]</p>
<table>
  <col id="engName" />
  <col id="endTag" />
  <col id="reqdAttr" />
  <col id="elementType" />
  <col id="elementReqs" />

    <th>English names</th>
    <th>Closing tag</th>
    <th>Required attributes</th>
    <th>Type</th>

    <td>Page header, site navigation, page footer, etc.</td>
    <td>Required</td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>Flow/Block</td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>None, but it&rsquo;s polite to make a habit of putting <code>aside</code> after,
          or at the end of, <code>article</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>These elements are functionally identical to <code>div</code>, but they
  offer something that <code>div</code> doesn&rsquo;t: just as browsers know
  what to do with lists and form elements, they will eventually be able to
  do special things with these elements for which <code>div</code> can&rsquo;t
  provide any baked-in cues.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>head</code> and <code>header</code> elements are entirely
  different.</p>

<h4>The &ldquo;HTML5 Shim&rdquo;</h4>

<p>Older versions (6&ndash;8) of Microsoft Internet Explorer don&rsquo;t
  define the sectioning elements as parts of HTML, and cannot style them
  off the bat. To fix this problem, several people have written what are
  called &ldquo;HTML5 Shim&rdquo; utilities with JavaScript. Shim scripts
  fall into a broader class of scripts called &ldquo;polyfills&rdquo; that
  aid small tasks or cover gaps in browser support.</p>
<p>Two especially popular HTML5 Shim scripts can be found at <a class="linkage"
  href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shim/">http://code.google.com/p/html5shim/</a> and
  <a
  class="linkage" href="https://github.com/ahume/html5-shim">https://github.com/ahume/html5-shim</a>.</p>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>


<h3><code>p</code></h3>

        <li>Can only contain phrasing/inline elements, images, and HTML5 A/V elements</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>When we consider the structure of written language, there&rsquo;s an obvious
  progression of scope: word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, passage. Because
  paragraphs are meant to set off discrete ideas, they need to be set off
  in web documents as in all other kinds&hellip; and that place is carved
  out by the <code>p</code> element.</p>

<h4>Print Paragraphs and Web Paragraphs</h4>

<p>Web pages <em>scroll</em> while printed pages stand still. This difference
  explains default paragraph styling in web browsers, where paragraphs are
  easier to read if they&rsquo;re clearly set apart.</p>
<p>If you want to attempt a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; look, apply the following
  CSS rule:</p>
<pre class="code-cutout">p { margin: 0; text-indent: 1.618em; text-align: justify; }</pre>


<h3>Introducing Collapsed Margins and Resets</h3>

<p>When two HTML elements with non-zero margins lie aside one another, whether
  in a stack or a row, those margins <strong>collapse</strong> so that only
  the larger of the two parallel margins is visible on the rendered page.
  Since this behavior makes it more difficult to control page layout, professional
  developers often create what they call <strong>reset styles</strong>.</p>
<p>This author doesn&rsquo;t use reset styles, for one reason: they rely
  on <em>negation</em>, even where <em>consistency</em> is more desirable.</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>


<h3><code>h1</code> &hellip; <code>h6</code></h3>

<table>
  <col id="engName" />
  <col id="endTag" />
  <col id="reqdAttr" />
  <col id="elementType" />
  <col id="elementReqs" />
  <thead>
    <th>English name</th>
    <th>Closing tag</th>
    <th>Required attributes</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Notable Requirements</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <td>Heading (level 1&ndash;6)</td>
    <td>Required</td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>Flow/Block (heading)</td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The levels of successive headings within the same parent element should
          always descend.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Pages need titles, but the same is true of individual document sections,
  which is where headings come in. Well-composed headings can <strong>break up your content</strong> to
  make it both more readable, and more legible. More importantly, they also
  help the <strong>search engine performance</strong> of your pages.</p>
<p><code>h1</code> elements are most-significant; there should only be one
  on each page. The <code>h4</code> element, on the other hand has always been
  styled by default at the same size as normal text, so it might be better
  to use <code>h3</code> or <code>h4</code> as your most typical heading level,
  then increase heading levels further as their scope broadens. <small>See attached illustration.</small>
</p>

<h3>Yes, Headings Are Ugly</h3>

<p>Like word processors, web browsers tend to make the higher-level headings
  too big. The good news is that CSS allows you control the appearance of
  headings with the <code>font-size</code>  <small>xref</small>, <code>font-weight</code>  <small>xref</small>,
  and <code>margin</code>  <small>xref</small> properties.</p>

<h3>Using More Than One Typeface on a Page</h3>

<p>A common design technique in practically all textual media is to use one
  style of type for body copy, and another style for headings &mdash; for
  example, setting a newspaper article in Times or Palatino, while setting
  its title in Helvetica or Univers. The CSS <code>font-family</code> property <small>xref</small> and <code>@font-face</code> rule
  syntax <small>xref</small> allow you to do the same thing on your pages.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>


<h3><code>ul</code> and <code>ol</code></h3>

<table>
  <col id="engName" />

      <ul>
        <li>Must only contain list item (<code>li</code>) elements <small>xref</small> (which
          in turn are more flexible) and whitespace</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>We constantly encounter lists: to-do lists, shopping lists, feature lists,
  Top Ten lists&hellip; so lists were an obvious feature when Tim Berners-Lee
  started to create the technologies that we now call the web.</p>
<p>Web browsers support three explicit types of lists, of which two &mdash;
  unordered and ordered lists &mdash; are under discussion here. The only
  differences between these two are their tags (<code>ul</code> and <code>ol</code>)
  and the markers that are displayed when you use one or the other (bullets
  as opposed to numerals or letters).</p>
<p>Navigation links in HTML4.01 pages are often marked up within lists, which
  can be skipped or ignored by assistive technology.</p>

<h4>Attributes (HTML4.01 only)</h4>

<ul class="pairings">
  <li><strong>type</strong><span>Takes the enumerated values <code>1</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>a</code>. The <code>list-style-type</code> CSS property <small>xref</small> should be preferred whenever possible.</li>
    <li><strong>start</strong><span>When used with an integer value, changes the numbering of all the items on the list. Supplanted by CSS3 Lists and Numbering, which are notoriously difficult to understand.</li>
</ul>

### Choosing the Correct List Type

<p>Instinct usually offers the right judgement of the type of list that ought to be used in a particular situation.  The best thing to remember is that when an order is clearly meant, an ordered list should be used.</p>

<h3>Markers and Margins</h3>
<p>This author often uses CSS rules similar to what follows:</p>
<pre class="code-cutout">ul { padding-left: .618em; list-style-type: none; }
li { text-indent: -.618em; }</pre>
<p>The default browser style typically left-justifies list item <em>content</em> and right-justifies list markers, both to a common margin.
<p>Many browsers set the default <code>padding-left</code> value of lists to an absolute rather than proportional value, so lists set with an especially large or small <code>font-size</code> value might require some tweaking in this regard.</p>

<h2>List Items</h2>
<h3><code>li</code></h3>
<table>
    <col id="engName" />
    <col id="endTag" />
    <col id="reqdAttr" />
    <col id="elementType" />
    <col id="elementReqs" />
    <thead>
        <th>English name</th>
        <th>Closing tag</th>
        <th>Required attributes</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Notable Requirements</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <td>List item</td>
        <td>Optional</td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>Flow/block (list item)</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Must only have a <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> element as an immediate parent</li>
                <li>Must only have other <code>li</code> elements for siblings</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>List items are simple at first glance but don&rsquo;t always stay that way, because lots of things can &mdash; and should &mdash; be drawn up in lists.  <strong>Outlines</strong> are nested lists.  <strong>Rules</strong> or <strong>guidelines</strong> of conduct or procedure often appear in lists, contain multiple paragraphs (or even sections), and might require headings.  <strong>Site navigation</strong> is often presented in lists for accessibility reasons.</p>
<p>List items require flexibility, so the specifications treat them like page divisions and sections: pretty much anything goes with respect to their contents.</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<ul class="pairings">
    <li><strong>start</strong><span>Takes an integer value; when used within an ordered list, changes the numbering of that item and all successive list items. (HTML4.01 only)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nesting Lists</h3>
<p>To create a nested list, put a new list <em>inside</em> a list item, like this:</p>
<pre class="code-cutout">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Berries
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blackberries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strawberries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raspberries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orchard fruit
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plums&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<p><small>I&rsquo;ve collapsed my carriage returns here, but it might be possible to set it differently in production.</small></p>
<p>The outermost list will have top and bottom margins as usual, but the nested lists will not.</p>
<p>The markup pattern shown above can recurse as many times as needed; this author has created his share of lists nested six and seven levels deep.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>
<h3><code>img</code></h3>
<table>
    <col id="engName" />
    <col id="endTag" />
    <col id="reqdAttr" />
    <col id="elementType" />
    <col id="elementReqs" />
    <thead>
        <th>English name</th>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <td>Image</td>
        <td>Forbidden</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li><code>src</code></li>
                <li><code>alt</code></li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>Embedded/replaced</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li><code>alt</code> must be present, but its value should be left empty (i.e., <code>alt=&quot;&quot;</code>) if the image cannot be assigned a meaningful text description</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Like most of the other elements introduced in this section, the <code>img</code> element is pretty simple if you want it that way:  reference a valid image URL with the <code>src</code> attribute, and the browser will insert the image it finds at that location onto the page.</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>
<ul class="pairings">
    <li><strong>src</strong><span>a valid URL referencing the image to be rendered; can be either an <code>http://</code> or <code>data:</code> URL</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>alt</strong><span>a string that provides a text description of the image</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>width</strong><span>an integer or percentage value; integers are parsed as the desired display width in pixels, percentages as the desired proportion of the display width encoded in the image</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>height</strong><span>comparable to <code>width</code></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Current web browsers all support images encoded in the PNG (Portable Network
  Graphics), GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), JPEG (Joint Photographic
  Experts Group), and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) formats. The filenames
  of images encoded in these formats typically end in <code>.png</code>, <code>.gif</code>, <code>.jpg</code>,
  and <code>.svg</code> respectively.</p>

<h3>Things to Remember About Images</h3>

<ul class="punchlist">
  <li>If an image request returns a Not Found (404) error or a corrupt stream,
    browsers typically render the image&rsquo;s <code>alt</code> value in its
    place.</li>
  <li>For best results, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values should
    be provided as integers (representing pixels) to avoid undesirable layout
    effects.</li>
  <li>The <code>img</code> element should be used for unambiguous <em>content</em>,
    and design accents relegated to CSS <code>background-image</code> attributes.</li>
  <li>The four formats described above are each best suited to specific types
    of presentation: PNG when a transparent canvas/matte is called for, GIF
    to flat-color illustrations like infographics and cartoons, JPEG to photography
    and &ldquo;photorealistic&rdquo; illustrations, and SVG to vector drawings
    and vector animations. GIF images can also be animated, but often consume
    more network resources than an equivalent SVG or Flash presentation.</li>
  <li>SVG images can be exported to a raster format (PNG, GIF, JPEG) without
    loss of quality at a given size, but exports in the opposite direction
    cannot.</li>
  <li>JPEG compression is &ldquo;lossy&rdquo; so that all other factors being
    equal, an image exported to the JPEG format will result in lower image
    fidelity.</li>
  <li>Resized copies of raster images will always be of lower quality than the
    originals, but good tools offer ways to minimize this loss of quality.</li>
  <li>Used properly, <code>data</code>-URL encoded PNGs can conserve network
    resources, thus reducing page render time. <code>data</code>-URL encoding
    is discussed in the Advanced Topics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inline Frames</h2>


<h3><code>iframe</code></h3>

    <td>Inline frame</td>
    <td>Required</td>

          from a different domain than the site that publishes the <code>iframe</code> itself</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>iframe</code> element lays out like images in practice, you won&rsquo;t
  often see <code>iframe</code> elements containing pages that are served from
  the same site that serves the element itself. However, there are a lot
  of pages with inline frames in them, because they make excellent containers
  for third-party content like advertising and social media buttons.</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<ul class="pairings">
  <li><strong>src</strong><span>the URL of the page to be served in the inline frame</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>width</strong><span>the width in pixels of the inline frame</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>height</strong><span>the height in pixels of the inline frame</span>
  </li>
  <li><strong>name</strong><span>a string that allows the inline frame to respond to hypertext links with <code>target</code> values indentical to the value set on this attribute</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This list omits several attributes that are either too new to be supported
  broadly, too esoteric to justify inclusion in this book, or supplanted
  by CSS properties.</p>

<h3>Using Inline Frames</h3>

<p>Inline frames can be used to break many of the assumptions under which
  web browsers work, but they have one outstanding feature: they can be used
  to take content from Site &rdquo;B&rdquo; &mdash; often an advertisement
  or a video &mdash; for secure display in the visual context of Site &rdquo;A&rdquo;,
  presumably yours.</p>
<p>The most obvious purpose of an <code>iframe</code> is to create a single
  instance of a persistent site feature for repetition throughout the site,
  but there are other ways to do this that don&rsquo;t violate any of the
  assumptions under which web browsers operate <small>xref</small>.</p>

<p>The <code>em</code> element conveys emphasis of a word, phrase, or sentence.
  In visual (<code>screen, print</code>) media, this usually takes the form
  of italic or oblique (skewed-clockwise) text. Where present emphasis is
  especially valuable to assistive technology users, who will instantly know
  the difference between emphasis and text that&rsquo;s italicized for other
  reasons.</p>
<p>Underlined text can also suggest emphasis, but this should be avoided
  since underlines are traditionally used to identify hypertext links.</p>

<p>As its long-form name suggests, the <code>strong</code> element conveys
  even stronger emphasis than the <code>em</code> element. The typical visual
  styling for this element is bold text.</p>
<p><code>strong</code> elements should be preferred to <code>b</code> elements
  where appropriate, for the same reasons that <code>em</code> should be preferred
  to <code>i</code>.</p>
<p>Full capitalization offers another popular way to convey strong emphasis
  in text is full capitalization, but this should also be avoided, since
  long stretches of all-caps are harder to read than mixed-case text.</p>
<p>Other practical styling possibilities for all forms of emphasis are increased
  size and increased contrast, which are controlled with the <code>font-size</code>, <code>color</code>,
  and <code>background-color</code> CSS properties.</p>

<h2>Small text and Spans</h2>


<h3><code>small</code></h3>

<p>There are elements to provide emphasis, but what about de-emphasis, like
  spoken comments that would be made <i>sotto voce</i>? This voice is best
  taken up with the <code>small</code> element, and like its emphasized cousins,
  its default styles can be replaced with styles that reduce contrast rather
  than size.</p>
<p>This author is deluged with a stream of consciousness that tends to overrun
  its banks, so a visit to the product site for this book will probably uncover
  a few examples of this usage.</p>

<h3><code>span</code></h3>

<table>
  <col id="engName" />
  <col id="endTag" />
  <col id="reqdAttr" />
  <col id="elementType" />
  <col id="elementReqs" />
  <thead>
    <th>English name</th>
    <th>Closing tag</th>
    <th>Required attributes</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Notable Requirements</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <td>Generic span</td>
    <td>Required</td>
    <td>None (but <code>class</code> is likely)</td>
    <td>Phrasing/inline</td>
    <td>None</td>
  </tbody>

<p>Like its counterpart <code>div</code>  <small>xref</small>, <code>span</code> is
  a generic element most often used to attach JavaScript hooks or CSS selectors
  to a particular stretch of content, or spot on the page.</p>
<p>Another use for <code>span</code> is to avoid <strong>anonymous elements</strong>.
  Consider something like:</p>
<pre class="code-cutout">&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;photo1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;192&quot; height=&quot;144&quot; 
alt=&quot;A smiling face.&quot;&gt;Supporters greet the candidate at the airport.&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>This use of markup is considered a best practice in HTML4.01, but presents
  enough problems that the <code>figure</code>/<code>img</code>/<code>figcaption</code> complex <small>xref</small> was
  specified for HTML5. The text content of the example is rendered in a separate
  element, but that element is never exposed to CSS or JavaScript. Why allow
  that, when you can put an element of your own in there?</p>
